  		Dead last. She is just lazy. She does nothing. 
  		She doesn't even speak. I honestly don't even have 
  		a lot to say because I haven't seen the movie in so 
  		long cause it just sucked. Sorry dear, go back to bed.

  <h2 class="ranking"> #9- Merida? Brave? Who knows. </h2>

  <p class="container-p">  
  	Coming in second to last is Brave. Well, her name isn't Brave. It's Merida. Which is a reason she is ranked so low. No one even knows her real name, which is kind of key. Not only is her hair a mess ALL OF THE TIME, but she is really hard to understand, and this is difficult for young children who often times are not yet exposed to Scottish accents during their first years of life. Obviously. She doesn't rank dead last beacuse she still is a bad-ass and is down for just about anything. She's "brave", we get it. </p>

  <h2 class="ranking">#8- Snow White</h2>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e1/Snow_white_disney.png" width="200px" height="400px">

    <div class="text-container">
    <p class="container-p">
  	Just, weird all around. First all all, she talks in a baby voice the entire time. Grow up. Second of all, it's weird she lives in a hut with seven little men. Like, I guess she gets some points for being nice to animals??? Still dumb enough to take food from strangers though (poisoned apple). Did your parents teach you NOTHING, Snow?? </p>

  	</div>

  <h2 class="ranking">#7- Ana</h2>
  <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/9/97/Anna_Render2.png/revision/latest?cb=20160211030147" width="200px" height="400px">

  	<div class="text-container">
    <p class="container-p">
  	Number 7, not an AWFUL standing. But not even in the top half. This princess, a recent hit, makes the mistake that most of us ladies do in falling for the wrong guy. But cmon, she fell for the first guy that she like, ever laid eyes on, considering she was locked inside all her life. We can't really blame her, but her trust for this guy kind of screwed over all of Arandale. Actaully, her sister kind of did. But she provoked her sister to get so upset so0o0o whose fault was this etenal ice and snow???? </p>

  <h2 class="ranking">#6- Ariel</h2>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/77/Ariel_disney.png" width="200px" height="400px">

  	<div class="text-container">
  	<p class="container-p">
  	Probbaly my first favorite princess, from the age of four. That has to count for something. However, it only occurs to me now, as I have grown, how disloyal this girl really is. Her entire life is in the ocean, including family, friends. And all this greedy little princess wants is to explore something she knows nothing of. All for what, a man?? PrincenEric, though, is def the hottest Prince out there, so I guess we understand why she did it?? Still, she ditched just about everyone. #traitor </p>

  <h2 class="ranking">#5- Tiana</h2>
  <img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/6/6f/Tiana_CC012272_Kopie.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20141123132849" width="250px" height="400px">

  	I'm not even going to pretend I know enough about Tiana to write an accurate review. I just know I like her better than everyone previously listed. So, check this out for some honest insight: </p>

  <h2 class="ranking">#4- Rapunzel</h2>

    <p class="container-p">
  	UNREAL MOVIE. UNREAL SOUNDTRACK. She has an epic voice, she's brave and spontaneous. Honestly, very few flaws here with this one. All I could say is that it's pretty gross that she drags her hair all over the floor and uses it as a broom. </p>
